Review all n8n workflow JSON files in this project and provide a status report:

1. Read `n8n-workflow-vapi-call-handler.json` and `n8n-workflow-notifications.json`
2. List all nodes in each workflow with their type and purpose
3. Identify any nodes that have placeholder/TODO values that need real credentials or endpoints
4. Check the connections between nodes for any gaps or missing links
5. Summarize what's working vs. what still needs configuration

Format the output as a clear status table.
