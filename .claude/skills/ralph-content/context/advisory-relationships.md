## How to Apply

When creating content that mentions competitors or market players:

1. **Check this list first** before using any company as a negative example
2. **Use generic framing** for business model critiques (e.g., "product-driven models" instead of naming specific companies)
3. **Neutral positioning** in competitive landscape diagrams—same colors as peers, no asterisks or callouts
4. **If uncertain**, default to excluding specific company names when discussing structural problems

## Adding New Relationships

When informed of a new advisory relationship:

2. Search existing content for potential issues
3. Update any published content that conflicts
