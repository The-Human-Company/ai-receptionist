# Every.to Voice Patterns

Based on analysis of 75+ Every newsletters (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026). These patterns define the editorial voice for NextGenMed content.

## Core Philosophy

Every newsletter exists to deliver one clear, valuable insight with ruthless specificity. Readers should finish thinking "I understand something now that I didn't before" AND have concrete names, numbers, and timeframes to reference.

### The Golden Rules
1. **Be Specific** — Names, numbers, timeframes in every claim
2. **Be Confident** — "Will" not "might," unless genuinely uncertain
3. **Be Concrete** — Every abstraction needs a real example
4. **Be Human** — Show process, admit limits, use "I" naturally
5. **Point Forward** — Conclusions about implications, never summaries

---

## Opening Constructions

Hook patterns that pull readers in immediately with specificity.

### Concrete Scenario
**Formula:** At [specific time], [specific situation]. [Immediate tension/surprise]. [Concrete numbers that ground].

**Example:** "At 2:17 a.m., your customer fires you and your CRM software. The reason? Their sales rep calculated that your $30,000 annual contract only delivers $12,000 in value. There was no meeting—because the sales rep was an AI agent."

**When to use:** Strategic/business content, industry analysis

### Metaphor Hook
**Formula:** Traditional [X] is built like [Y]. [Rich sensory details]. [Personal admission follows].

**Example:** "Traditional software is built like a skyscraper. Any application you use daily is a bronze and glass facade towering 500 feet above the street. It is a lobby with travertine walls that smells faintly of sandalwood. Just to be real with you, I am jealous of architects."

**When to use:** Personal/philosophical content, conceptual pieces

### Pattern Recognition
**Formula:** I've spent [timeframe] [doing X], watching [pattern]. [Establish credibility]. [Name the pattern].

**Example:** "I've spent the last eight years as an investor—at Andreessen Horowitz and now at my own firm, Worldbuild—watching the same pattern repeat. Software was locked in an era of homogeneity, one dictated by a well-trodden path of fundraising instead of true innovation."

**When to use:** Trend analysis, market commentary

## Transition Patterns

Techniques for clarity, emphasis, and flow.

### Colon Technique
**Usage:** Introduce concepts, lists, clarifications. Use 3+ times per piece.

**Formula:** [Setup statement]: [Clarification/expansion]

**Examples:**
- "Knowledge compounders: Data that learns while you sleep"
- "The answer is simpler than it seems: relationship capital."
- "Here's what matters: the infrastructure AI must flow through"

### Em-Dash Mastery
Use em-dashes (—) for three distinct purposes. Use 3+ per piece.

**1. Clarification/Definition:**
"These aren't the companies with the best models or the slickest interfaces—they're the ones that own the boring yet essential infrastructure AI must flow through."

**2. Aside/Context:**
"The writer and investor—now at Pace Capital—explored what happens when AI agents become your primary users."

**3. Contrast/Emphasis:**
"Agents don't need training like human users, and they don't have loyalty. They evaluate economics in milliseconds and switch the moment it makes business sense—even in the middle of the night."

### Historical Parallel
**Formula:** Think of it like [familiar historical moment]: Before [major outcomes], we needed [infrastructure]. We're in that moment again, but for [current topic].

**Example:** "Think of it like the early internet: Before companies could build Google or Amazon, we needed HTTP and TCP/IP—the invisible communications rules that let computers talk. We're in that moment again, but for AI agents."

### Translation Phrases
- "The thing about [X] is..."
- "Here's what that means..."
- "In practice, that means..."
- "Just to be real with you..."

---

## Emphasis Techniques

Strategic use of rhythm and structure for maximum impact.

### One-Sentence Paragraphs
**When to use:** After building context, to deliver the punchline, for dramatic beats, maximum emphasis.

**Examples:**
- "It's pure ruthlessness."
- "And it's not close."
- "This is your map."
- "The era of OpenAI 'blazing ahead alone' is over."

**Frequency:** 3-6 times per piece, NEVER multiple in a row.

### Sentence Rhythm Pattern
**Formula:** [LONG 30-50 words: Set up complex idea] → [SHORT 5-15 words: Deliver punchline.] → [MEDIUM 15-30 words: Develop and transition.]

**Example:** "When AI models commoditize—when the latest GPT, Claude, and Gemini models are all making similar decisions based on similar capabilities—the competitive edge shifts to having the infrastructure between algorithmic decisions and real-world consequences. This is the infrastructure that AI can't route around. And the next few years will determine who owns this layer."

### Emphasis Phrases
- "It's not [X]—it's [Y]"
- "What endures is..."
- "The era of [X] is over."

## Evidence Patterns

Specificity standards for credible, concrete argumentation.

### Company Example Structure
**Requirements:**
1. Full company name
2. What they do (if not obvious)
3. Specific achievement or number
4. Timeframe for changes
5. Industry context (if lesser-known)

**Template:** "[Company name] is a [location]-based [what they do] that [key metric]. Between [period] and [period], [specific achievement with number]. [Industry leaders] including [Company A], [descriptor for Company B], and [Company C] rely on [the platform/product]."

**Example:** "Between early 2025 and the fall, n8n's valuation climbed from roughly $300 million to $2.5 billion. Major companies including Vodafone, food delivery giant Delivery Hero, and Microsoft rely on the platform to orchestrate AI-powered operations."

### Evidence Cascade
**Formula:** Stack 3+ specific examples in quick succession with parallel structure.

**Connector words:** "similarly," "also," "as has," "including"

**Example:** "Those include Oracle, which is increasing its pipeline of contracts to supply compute to model builders to nearly half a trillion dollars. AI cloud companies CoreWeave and Crusoe have similarly been beneficiaries of this wave, pivoting from bitcoin mining to compute and data centers for AI labs, as has Scale AI, with its recent $14 billion investment from Meta."

### Specificity Standards

**Always include:**
- **Names:** Specific people, companies, products (never "a startup" or "experts")
- **Numbers:** Exact figures ($2.5B not "billions", 47 words not "long sentence")
- **Timeframes:** Specific periods ("between early 2025 and the fall" not "recently")

**Quick Fixes:**
| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Many companies" | "Oracle, CoreWeave, and Scale AI" |
| "Significant growth" | "From $300M to $2.5B" |
| "Recently" | "Between early 2025 and the fall" |
| "Experts say" | "Reid Hoffman predicts" |
| "A startup" | "Berlin-based workflow platform n8n" |
| "Several studies" | "Levine et al., Nature Aging, 2026" |

## Klosterman Techniques (Optional — Use with --voice klosterman)

Chuck Klosterman's writing brings intellectual playfulness and unexpected depth. Use these techniques when the user explicitly requests Klosterman voice or style. When invoked, these patterns should be woven throughout the content.

### The Hypothetical Pivot
**Formula:** "What if [seemingly absurd scenario]?" Then treat it seriously, revealing something true about the actual topic.

**Example:** "What if we discovered that metformin only works because people who take it unconsciously eat 200 fewer calories per day? Not because of any molecular mechanism—just because swallowing a pill makes them feel like they're 'doing something' about aging, which makes them marginally more disciplined at dinner. Would that make metformin less valuable? I'd argue it wouldn't. And that thought experiment tells us something important about how we evaluate longevity interventions."

**When to use:** When you need to reframe assumptions, challenge conventional thinking, or make readers question why they believe what they believe.

### The Unlikely Connection
**Formula:** Link the scientific topic to something culturally unexpected—a TV show, a sports moment, a band from the '80s—then show why the connection is actually profound.

**Example:** "The debate over whether to treat aging as a disease reminds me of the moment in 1995 when the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame had to decide if it should induct KISS. The argument against: KISS wasn't really 'good' in any traditional sense. The argument for: millions of people's lives were genuinely changed by them, and isn't that what matters? The FDA is having the same argument about rapamycin right now, except the stakes are whether your insurance will cover it."

**When to use:** For complex or dry topics that need an entry point; when you want readers to see familiar debates in a new light.

### The Self-Aware Aside
**Formula:** Mid-argument, acknowledge what you're doing, question your own premise, or admit the limits of your reasoning. Use parentheses or em-dashes.

**Examples:**
- "(I realize I'm oversimplifying this, but the oversimplification might be the point.)"
- "Now, you might argue that I'm cherry-picking studies here—and you'd be partially right. But the cherries I'm picking are the only ones that actually ripened."
- "This is the part where I'm supposed to tell you what to do with this information. I'm not sure I can."

**When to use:** When making bold claims; when the honest answer is uncertain; when you want to build trust through intellectual humility.

### The "But Here's The Thing" Pivot
**Formula:** Present the conventional understanding. Pause. Then subvert it with "But here's the thing:" or "Except that's not quite right."

**Example:** "The standard narrative about GLP-1 agonists is that they work by suppressing appetite. Take the drug, feel less hungry, eat less, lose weight. Simple. Except that's not quite right. The weight loss often exceeds what the appetite suppression alone would predict. Something else is happening—and that something else might be more important than the appetite part."

**When to use:** Any time you're about to deliver the real insight after setting up expectations.

### The Rhetorical Question That Reframes
**Formula:** Ask a question that makes the reader realize they've been thinking about the topic wrong. The question itself is the insight.

**Examples:**
- "Why do we assume that living longer is the same as aging slower?"
- "What if the problem with longevity research isn't that we don't know enough—but that we know too much to act on any of it?"
- "Is a 70-year-old who feels 50 actually younger than a 50-year-old who feels 70?"

**When to use:** Thesis moments; transitions between sections; conclusions.

### The Winding Build
**Formula:** Start a sentence that appears to be going somewhere obvious, take 2-3 apparent detours, then land on something unexpected. The detours aren't tangents—they're load-bearing.

**Example:** "The reason Peter Attia spends so much time talking about zone 2 cardio—and the reason his audience, which consists largely of people who could afford personal trainers and elaborate biohacking protocols, nonetheless fixates on this particular low-tech intervention—is that zone 2 represents something medicine rarely offers: a thing you can do yourself, that costs nothing, that probably works, and that doesn't require you to trust anyone's claims about what's happening inside your cells."

**When to use:** Key insights that need buildup; moments where the "obvious" answer isn't the real answer.

### Specific Over Generic (Klosterman Edition)
Klosterman never says "a rock band"—he says "Mötley Crüe in 1987." Apply this to longevity content:

| Generic | Klosterman-Specific |
|---------|---------------------|
| "A patient with metabolic issues" | "A 58-year-old software engineer in Austin whose fasting glucose has been creeping up for seven years" |
| "Some researchers believe" | "Matt Kaeberlein told me something last year that I keep thinking about" |
| "The supplement industry" | "The specific aisle in Whole Foods where people stand for 20 minutes reading labels" |
