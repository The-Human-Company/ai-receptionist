# Quality Rubrics

Quality evaluation criteria for all content types. Use these to self-critique and decide when content is ready.

## Newsletter Quality Rubric (Every.to 8-Point)

Evaluate each criterion. Content is ready when all 8 pass.

### 1. Specificity Check
**Question:** Does EVERY significant claim include names, numbers, and timeframes?

**Passes when:**
- Names: Specific people, companies, products (never "experts say" or "a startup")
- Numbers: Exact figures ("$2.5B" not "billions")
- Timeframes: Specific periods ("between early 2025 and fall" not "recently")
- The piece passes the "Ctrl+F test" — searching for "many," "several," "significant," "experts" returns zero vague results

**Fails when:** More than 2 paragraphs lack specific names/numbers

### 2. Evidence Cascade Present
**Question:** Are there 3+ specific examples stacked together for major claims?

**Passes when:**
- Pattern appears: "[Company A] achieved [metric]. Similarly, [Company B] [result]. As did [Company C] with [data]."
- Uses connectors: "similarly," "as did," "including"
- At least one evidence cascade appears for a key claim

**Fails when:** Major claims rely on single examples or generalizations

### 3. Colon Technique Used
**Question:** Does the piece use colon technique to introduce key concepts?

**Passes when:**
- Patterns like "Here's what matters: [insight]" or "The key limitation: [issue]" appear
- Used 3+ times for thesis introduction, framework points, or clarifications
- Strategic use (not just in lists)

**Fails when:** No strategic colon usage or fewer than 3 instances

### 4. Em-Dash Clarity
**Question:** Are em-dashes used correctly for Every's three purposes?

**Three purposes:**
1. Clarification: "The inflammasome—NLRP3 specifically—acts as..."
2. Context/aside: "The writer—now at Pace Capital—explored..."
3. Contrast: "Not the best models—the ones that own infrastructure"

**Passes when:** Em-dashes appear and serve one of these functions (3+ instances)

**Fails when:** Absent, misused, or fewer than 3 instances

### 5. One-Sentence Emphasis
**Question:** Are there strategic one-sentence paragraphs at key moments?

**Passes when:**
- 3-6 one-sentence paragraphs appear
- Placed after building context, delivering punchlines
- Examples: "It's pure ruthlessness." "And it's not close." "The timing matters more than the dose."

**Fails when:** No one-sentence paragraphs, or more than 6 (overused), or multiple in a row

### 6. Concrete Over Abstract
**Question:** Does the opening ground readers in something tangible?

**Hook types that pass:**
- Specific case: "Dr. Sarah Chen at Stanford saw..."
- Paradox: "The standard approach assumes... But..."
- Metaphor with sensory detail

**Fails when:**
- Opening with "In today's rapidly evolving..." or "Longevity medicine is..."
- First paragraph lacks concrete details (names, places, numbers, sensory info)

### 7. Voice Authenticity
**Question:** Does it match Every.to voice principles?

**Passes when:**
- Intellectually rigorous yet accessible
- Confident assertions backed by evidence
- Personal without self-indulgence
- Uses characteristic phrases: "Just to be real with you," "Here's what that means"
- No hedging with "might" when "will" is meant

**Fails when:** Feels generic, corporate, or excessively hedged

### 8. Forward-Looking Conclusion
**Question:** Does the conclusion point forward, not summarize?

**Patterns that pass:**
- "And the next [timeframe] will determine [stakes]"
- "If you [condition], you need to [action]"

**Fails when:**
- "In conclusion, we've covered..." or "To summarize the key points..."
- Ending discusses what was said instead of implications

## LinkedIn Quality Rubric (14-Point)

## Instagram Script Quality Rubric

For spoken-word video scripts (30-90 seconds).

### Hook (3 points)
1. **stops_scroll**: First 3 seconds grab attention with surprising statement or question
2. **under_10_words**: Hook is 10 words or fewer
3. **creates_open_loop**: Hook creates curiosity that body resolves

### Body (4 points)
4. **spoken_naturally**: Written for voice, not text (contractions, conversational)
5. **single_focus**: One clear idea, no tangents
6. **evidence_included**: At least one specific fact, study, or example
7. **correct_duration**: 30-90 seconds when read at natural pace (~150 words/min)

### Close (3 points)
8. **clear_takeaway**: Viewer knows the one thing to remember
9. **has_cta**: Ends with clear next step (follow, comment, save)
10. **no_abrupt_end**: Feels complete, not cut off

## Regulatory Brief Quality Rubric (12-Point)

For FDA committee briefs, safety summaries, and technical regulatory documents.

### Structure (4 points)
1. **header_complete**: Header includes document type, subject identifier, and key metadata (MW, sequence, CAS# for peptides)
2. **three_section_structure**: Document has Safety Data, Regulatory Precedent, and Conclusion sections
3. **print_optimized**: Layout fits on one page (8.5"×11") with 0.75" margins
4. **table_format_used**: Route-specific data or comparisons use tables, not prose

### Safety Data Section (4 points)

### Conclusion (2 points)
11. **evidence_gaps_explicit**: Conclusion explicitly states what evidence is missing or limited
12. **recommendation_conditional**: Recommendation includes conditions or alternatives, not binary approve/reject

**Passes when:** All 12 criteria are TRUE. For regulatory content, there is no partial pass.

### Reasoning Consistency Framework

When creating multiple related regulatory briefs, ensure conclusions are proportional to evidence:

| Evidence Type | Relative Weight | Example |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| FDA-approved drugs in same class | High | Setmelanotide for melanocortin peptides |
| Human clinical trial data (direct) | High | n=107 withdrawal study |
| Non-U.S. regulatory approval | Medium | Russian Deltaran registration |
| Preclinical animal data only | Medium-Low | Mouse colitis models |
| Mechanism well-characterized | Medium | PepT1/NF-κB pathway |
| Endogenous origin | Low (safety inference only) | Natural peptide fragment |

**Consistency check:** If Document A has human trial data and Document B only has preclinical + class precedent, both can reach favorable conclusions BUT the reasoning must be explicit:
- Document A: "Direct human evidence supports safety"
- Document B: "Class-level precedent and preclinical data support safety, though direct human evidence is absent"

## How to Use These Rubrics

When self-critiquing:
1. Read through your content
2. Evaluate each criterion honestly
3. For failures, note the specific issue and location
4. Revise to address failures
5. Re-evaluate until all criteria pass

The goal is not perfection on first draft—it's iteration until quality threshold is met.
