  "description": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a master regulator of cell growth, integrating signals from nutrients (especially amino acids), growth factors (IGF-1, insulin), and energy status (ATP levels). mTOR exists in two complexes: mTORC1 (promotes anabolism, inhibits autophagy) and mTORC2 (regulates metabolism and survival). This pathway is central to aging biology and is a key target for longevity interventions.",
