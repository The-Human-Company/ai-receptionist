# EduSales Writer Skill

A Claude Code skill for writing educational sales content that teaches first and sells naturally.

## What is EduSales?

EduSales content combines genuine education with native product promotion. Instead of pushy sales copy, you create content that:
- Delivers real value through teaching
- Builds trust and authority
- Positions your product as the natural solution
- Makes readers feel smarter, not sold to

## Supported Content Types

- **LinkedIn Posts** - Thought leadership with soft promotion
- **Email Sequences** - Nurture campaigns that educate and convert
- **Single Emails** - Promotional emails that don't feel promotional
- **Twitter/X Threads** - Educational threads with natural CTAs
- **Newsletter Content** - Value-packed issues with product mentions
- **Launch Announcements** - Hype-building content that teaches

## Quick Start

Invoke the skill and provide:

```
Content type: LinkedIn post
Product: [Your product name and what it does]
Target audience: [Who you're writing for]
Educational angle: [What insight/framework you're teaching]
CTA: [What action you want readers to take]
```

## The Framework

Every piece of edusales content follows this flow:

1. **HOOK** - Pattern interrupt that stops the scroll
2. **EDUCATE** - Genuine value and insight
3. **BRIDGE** - Natural transition to your solution
4. **OFFER** - Soft product mention
5. **CTA** - Clear next step
