# EduSales Content Writer

## Overview
This skill creates **educational sales content** - content that provides genuine value through teaching while naturally positioning a product or service as the solution. The goal is content that readers *want* to engage with because they learn something, and where the promotion feels helpful rather than pushy.

## Core Philosophy

**Edusales = Education + Native Promotion**

The best promotional content doesn't feel promotional. It:
- Leads with value and insight
- Establishes authority through teaching
- Positions the product as a natural extension of the lesson
- Makes the reader feel smarter, not sold to

## Content Types Supported

### 1. LinkedIn Posts
### 2. Email Sequences / Nurture Campaigns
### 3. Single Promotional Emails
### 4. Social Media Posts (Twitter/X, Instagram captions)
### 5. Newsletter Content
### 6. Launch Announcements

## The EduSales Framework

Every piece of content follows this psychological flow:

### Stage 1: HOOK (Pattern Interrupt)
Grab attention with something unexpected, relatable, or provocative.

**Hook Types:**
- **Contrarian**: Challenge a common belief
- **Story**: Personal narrative that draws them in
- **Hypothetical**: "If I had to start over..."
- **Curiosity Gap**: Promise valuable knowledge
- **Pain Point**: Name their struggle specifically
- **Bold Claim**: Make a statement they need to verify

**Examples:**
- "If I lost everything today, here's exactly what I'd do"
- "After 3 years with AI, I've finally cracked my workflow"
- "Most people get this completely wrong"
- "The problem isn't [obvious thing]. It's [surprising thing]."

### Stage 2: EDUCATE (Value Delivery)
Deliver genuine, actionable insight. This is where trust is built.

**Education Formats:**
- Step-by-step frameworks
- Behind-the-scenes breakdowns
- "Here's what actually works" revelations
- Mistakes to avoid
- Industry secrets or counterintuitive truths
- Personal learnings from experience

**Rules:**
- Be specific, not vague
- Use concrete examples
- Make it actionable
- Don't hold back value to "save it for the sale"

### Stage 3: BRIDGE (Natural Transition)
Connect the education to your solution without a jarring shift.

**Bridge Phrases:**
- "This is exactly why I built..."
- "It's the same approach I've baked into..."
- "This is what [Product] does automatically..."
- "I've productized this entire process in..."
- "After doing this manually, I created..."

### Stage 4: OFFER (Soft Promotion)
Present your product/service as a natural next step, not a hard sell.

**Offer Styles:**
- **Resource**: "If you want to go deeper, here's where to start"
- **Tool**: "I built [Tool] to handle this for you"
- **Waitlist**: "We're opening to X new users"
- **Free Value**: "Grab my free [resource] in the comments"
- **Social Proof**: "Join X others who are already using this"

### Stage 5: CTA (Clear Next Step)
One clear action. Make it easy.

**CTA Types:**
- Comment-based: "Drop 'YES' in the comments"
- Link-based: "Join the waitlist here: [link]"
- Engagement: "Save this for later"
- DM-based: "DM me [keyword] for access"

## Formatting Rules by Platform

### LinkedIn Posts

**Structure:**
```
[Hook - 1-2 lines, pattern interrupt]

[Gap line]

[Context/Problem - 2-3 short paragraphs]

[Education - bullet points, numbered lists, or short paragraphs]

[Bridge to product - 1-2 sentences]

[Soft CTA]

[Emoji or call for engagement] (optional)
```

**Formatting Guidelines:**
- First line = most important (it's the preview)
- Max 2-3 sentences per paragraph
- Use line breaks liberally (every 1-2 sentences)
- Bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Bold text sparingly for emphasis (use ** or nothing)
- Avoid walls of text
- Optimal length: 150-300 words

### Email Sequences

**Single Email Structure:**
```
Subject Line: [Curiosity/Benefit - keep under 50 chars]
Preview Text: [Expands on subject, adds intrigue]

[Personal opener - 1-2 sentences]

[Hook/Story that relates to their problem]

[Education section - the meat of the value]

[Bridge to your solution]

[Clear CTA with button or link]

[Sign off]
[P.S. - optional secondary CTA or reminder]
```

**Email Sequence Flow (5-7 emails typical):**

1. **Welcome/Story Email**: Your origin story, why you built this
2. **Problem Aware**: Agitate the pain, show you understand
3. **Education #1**: Teach a framework or concept
4. **Education #2**: Share case study or results
5. **Objection Handler**: Address common hesitations
6. **Social Proof**: Testimonials, results, community
7. **Final Push**: Urgency + recap of value

### Twitter/X Posts

**Structure:**
```
[Hook - punchy, 1 line]

[Value thread or single insight]

[CTA in final tweet or embedded naturally]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Even shorter paragraphs than LinkedIn
- More personality, less polish
- Threads work well for educational content
- Single tweets for hot takes and hooks

## Product Integration Techniques

### Technique 1: The "Why I Built This" Story
Frame the product as your solution to a problem you personally faced.

*Example:*
> "After rewriting 200+ client emails manually, I thought: there has to be a better way. That's why I built [Product]."

### Technique 2: The "Here's My Workflow" Reveal
Share your actual process, with your product as one natural tool in the stack.

*Example:*
> "My content workflow: 1) Capture ideas in Notion, 2) Draft in [Product], 3) Edit in Google Docs, 4) Schedule in Buffer"

### Technique 3: The "Hidden Feature" Tease
Educate about a capability, then reveal your product has it.

*Example:*
> "The best writers use 'swipe files' - collections of proven hooks and formats. I've built a swipe library directly into [Product]."

### Technique 4: The "Before/After" Contrast
Show the painful manual way vs. your solution.

*Example:*
> "Most people: Open ChatGPT, ask for generic post, get generic output.
> With [Product]: Feed it your voice, your swipes, your knowledge. Get YOU, faster."

### Technique 5: The "Social Proof Embed"
Let results do the selling.

*Example:*
> "After 50+ user calls, here's what I learned... [education]. This feedback shaped [Product] 2.0."

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### DO:

- Use "I" and "you" freely

### DON'T:
- Use corporate jargon
- Sound like a press release
- Make claims without backing them up

- Oversell or overpromise

### Power Words for EduSales:
- "Here's exactly..."
- "The truth is..."

## Example Outputs

### LinkedIn Post Example

**Input:**
- Product: AI writing tool called "Kleo"
- Benefit: Writes in your voice using your past content
- Audience: LinkedIn creators and entrepreneurs
- Hook: Workflow revelation
- CTA: Join waitlist

**Output:**
```
After 3 years with AI, 100s of LinkedIn posts, and 50+ user calls... I've finally cracked my workflow.

Most people open ChatGPT and type:

"Write me a LinkedIn post on [topic]."

That's why the output feels generic and nothing like you.

The problem isn't AI.
The problem is your workflow.

Here's what mine looks like:

1. Inputs
- Past posts to match your style
- Info on who you are and what you do
- Proven templates for winning formats
- Idea swipes from Reddit, X, LinkedIn...

2. Chat
Don't expect AI to one-shot a perfect post. You build it through conversation.

- "Give me post ideas from my knowledge base"
- "Write me 5 hook variations"
- "Re-write this part"

3. Publish
Preview, polish formatting, add visuals, schedule.

Your expertise goes in.
AI organizes and sharpens it.
The output feels 100% yours (only faster).

This is the exact workflow I've built into Kleo 2.0.

We're inviting 500 beta users next week.

### Email Example

**Input:**
- Product: Copywriting course
- Benefit: Learn the meta-skill that drives all marketing
- Audience: Aspiring entrepreneurs
- Hook: "If I lost everything" hypothetical
- CTA: Enroll now

**Output:**
```
Subject: The one skill I'd rebuild everything on
Preview: If I had to start from zero tomorrow...

Hey [Name],

If I lost everything today - business, audience, savings - here's the one skill I'd use to rebuild.

Copywriting.

Not design. Not coding. Not even "building products."

Writing.

Because writing is the meta-skill underneath everything:

→ Good writing = viral content
→ Good writing = audiences that trust you
→ Good writing = sales without feeling salesy

And here's the thing: anyone can learn it.

You don't need a degree. You don't need connections. You just need to understand how words move people to action.

I've watched this skill hold its value through every tech shift - social media, AI, whatever comes next.

The people who can write clearly and persuasively will always be in demand.

That's why I put together [Course Name] - everything I've learned about writing that sells, without feeling gross.

[CTA Button: See what's inside]

Talk soon,
[Name]

P.S. - The first module alone has helped students 3x their email open rates. Just saying.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **The Bait-and-Switch**: Don't promise education then deliver a sales pitch
2. **The Feature Dump**: Don't list features; show transformation
3. **The Humble Brag**: Don't educate just to show off
4. **The Premature Pitch**: Don't mention your product in the first paragraph
5. **The Generic Hook**: Don't open with "In today's fast-paced world..."
6. **The Wall of Text**: Don't skip formatting for "efficiency"
7. **The Weak CTA**: Don't end with "let me know what you think"
