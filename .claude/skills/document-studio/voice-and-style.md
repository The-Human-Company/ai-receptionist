# NGM Voice & Style Guide

This guide defines the voice, tone, and writing style for all NGM documents. Consistency in voice builds brand recognition and trust.

---

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Confident Authority
We speak from experience—building clinics, advising companies, treating patients. We don't hedge unnecessarily or use weak language.

**Instead of:**
> "We believe our platform might help improve your outcomes."

**Write:**
> "Our platform reduces report generation time from 45 minutes to 5 minutes."

### 2. Specific Over Vague
Concrete numbers, real examples, and specific outcomes. Avoid superlatives and generic claims.

**Instead of:**
> "World-class expertise in longevity medicine."

**Write:**
> "Built the first national-scale longevity clinic in the United States. Advisor to companies valued at over $1 billion combined."

### 3. First-Principles Reasoning
We explain the WHY, not just the what. We help readers understand the mechanism, not just the outcome.

**Instead of:**
> "Our knowledge base is comprehensive and up-to-date."

**Write:**
> "The knowledge base is intentionally curated—not comprehensive. Feeding AI everything produces washed-out, average answers. The value is in knowing what to include, what to exclude, and how to weight different sources."

### 4. Personable Expertise
Expert but approachable. We're a colleague, not a lecturer. We use accessible language without dumbing down.

**Instead of:**
> "The etiological factors contributing to metabolic dysfunction require systematic evaluation."

**Write:**
> "Metabolic dysfunction doesn't happen overnight. We trace back to the root causes—sleep, stress, diet, movement—and address them systematically."

### 5. Outcome-Focused
Lead with transformation and results. Features support outcomes; they don't replace them.

**Instead of:**
> "Our platform includes 150+ educational modules, AI-powered reports, and a community."

**Write:**
> "Physicians using our platform go from $200/visit to $1,500 6-month programs while reducing patient load from 25+ to 12 per week."

## Tone by Document Type

### Proposals
- **Tone**: Consultative, attentive, collaborative
- **Perspective**: First person ("I" or "we") after establishing relationship
- **Structure**: Problem → Understanding → Solution → Why Us → Investment → Next Steps
- **Key**: Show you listened. Reference specific things from the conversation.

**Example opening:**
> "Based on our conversation, Welldercare is positioned to become a leader in longevity medicine but needs to translate its impressive technical foundation into differentiated customer outcomes."

### Flyers & Marketing
- **Tone**: Direct, benefit-focused, professional
- **Perspective**: Third person for Dr. Vinjamoori, direct address ("you") for audience
- **Structure**: Headline → Value props → Features → Social proof → CTA
- **Key**: Scannable. Reader should get the point in 10 seconds.

**Example headline:**
> "Get Discovered by Clinicians Ready to Buy"

**Example subhead:**
> "Longevity clinicians don't trust vendor marketing—they trust independent research."

### Sponsor Packets
- **Tone**: Prestigious, opportunity-focused, partnership-oriented
- **Perspective**: Third person, formal
- **Structure**: Vision → Opportunity → Benefits → Tiers → Leadership → Contact
- **Key**: Make sponsorship feel like joining a movement, not buying an ad.

**Example:**
> "Sponsoring the NGM Summit places your organization at the epicenter of a global movement to redefine aging, healthspan, and clinical innovation."

### One-Pagers
- **Tone**: Crisp, scannable, action-oriented
- **Perspective**: Mixed—third person for descriptions, direct address for benefits
- **Structure**: What → Why → How → Proof → CTA
- **Key**: Everything above the fold. One clear action.
