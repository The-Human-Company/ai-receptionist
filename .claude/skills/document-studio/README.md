## Voice & Style Summary

**Be:**
- Confident (not salesy)
- Specific (not vague)
- Outcome-focused (not feature-focused)
- Personable (not corporate)

**Avoid:**
- Buzzwords ("revolutionary", "cutting-edge")
- Vague superlatives ("best-in-class", "world-class")
- Salesy urgency ("Act now!")
- Feature dumping without context

**Example transformation:**

❌ "Our revolutionary AI-powered platform delivers world-class insights."

✅ "The platform synthesizes 50,000+ peer-reviewed studies into actionable clinical guidance—reducing report generation from 45 minutes to 5."

2. **Provide transcripts** — For proposals, paste the full meeting notes
3. **Reference existing docs** — "Make it similar to the Trellis proposal"
4. **Specify format** — "Print-ready 8.5x11" or "web-viewable"
5. **Indicate updates** — For changes, specify exactly what to modify

## Examples

```

### Flyer for conference
```
Create a 2-page print flyer for NGM Commons to hand out at the A4M conference. Focus on the vendor partnership benefits and include the QR code for sign-up.
```

### Update sponsor packet
```
Update the Vanguard Summit sponsor packet:
1. Change event date to March 15-16, 2026
2. Add a new "Founding Partner" tier at $25,000 with co-creation benefits
3. Update Dr. Agarwal's bio with her new role
```

### Adapt existing proposal

Take the Trellis proposal and adapt it for MedTech Labs. They're also building a clinical platform but focused on geriatrics rather than pregnancy. Keep the same structure and pricing approach.
