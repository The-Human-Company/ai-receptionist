## NGM Commons

### What It Is
Vendor intelligence platform for longevity, functional, and integrative medicine clinicians. Research-driven profiles of vendors, products, and services—built for AI discoverability.

### The Problem It Solves
Clinicians don't trust vendor marketing. They ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. If vendor content isn't structured for AI, they're invisible when it matters.

### Key Features
- Research-driven vendor profiles with citations
- AI-native structure (parseable by LLMs)
- Category comparisons and methodology breakdowns
- Independent research, not vendor-written content
- Lead capture and demo requests for partners

### Profile Components
1. **Quick Take** — Cited executive summary
2. **How It Works** — Mechanisms, workflows, architecture
3. **Evidence** — Research citations, validation data
4. **Practitioner Fit** — Which clinician types it's best for
5. **Metadata** — AI-parseable tags for discoverability
6. **Citations** — Every claim backed by references

### Partnership Tiers (for Vendors)

| Tier | Price | Benefits |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Partner** | $5,000/year | Full profile, brand customization, lead capture, analytics, category roundup inclusion |

**Startup Program:** 50% off first year for companies <2 years old or <$5M raised.

### Positioning Statements

**For vendors:**
> "We're profiling every vendor in the space. The question isn't whether you'll be included—it's whether you'll control your presence."

**For clinicians:**
> "Research solutions before you buy. Independent profiles, not vendor marketing."

**Headline:**
