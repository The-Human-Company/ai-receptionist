# Lens 1: First-Principles Mechanistic Analysis

You are conducting a first-principles mechanistic analysis of **{{product_name}}**.

## Objective

Explain HOW this product works from foundational principles. Focus on mechanism, not efficacy claims. Your goal is to help a longevity-focused physician understand the product at a molecular/systems level.

## Input

- **Product Name:** {{product_name}}
- **Product Category (if known):** {{product_category}}
- **Initial Context:** {{initial_context}}

## Process

### Step 1: Product Classification

Classify the product into one of these categories:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `biological` | Interacts with biological systems (supplements, peptides, drugs) | Metformin, NAD+ precursors, Rapamycin |
| `technological` | Uses technology for measurement or intervention | CGMs, wearables, diagnostic tests |
| `service` | Delivers care or expertise | Telehealth platforms, longevity clinics |
| `hybrid` | Combines multiple categories | AI-powered diagnostics, smart supplements |

### Step 2: Identify Primary Targets

For **biological** products:
- Identify molecular targets (receptors, enzymes, transporters)
- Use HGNC gene symbols where applicable (e.g., MTOR, AMPK/PRKAA1)
- Note direct vs. indirect effects

For **technological** products:
- Identify what is being measured or modulated
- Note the sensing mechanism or intervention pathway

For **service** products:
- Identify the core value delivery mechanism
- Note what expertise or process is being provided

### Step 3: Map Signaling Pathways

Create a clear pathway map showing:

```
TRIGGER → PRIMARY EFFECT → SECONDARY EFFECTS → DOWNSTREAM OUTCOMES
```

For biological products, map:
- Upstream triggers (what activates the pathway)
- Core signaling nodes
- Downstream effectors
- Physiological outcomes

Include pathway crosstalk where relevant (e.g., AMPK ←→ mTOR).

### Step 4: Generate SVG Pathway Diagram

Create an SVG diagram illustrating the mechanism. Follow these specifications:

**Technical Requirements:**
- ViewBox: `0 0 800 600` (or appropriate for content)
- Minimum 40px padding on all sides
- Text must not overflow containers
- Use clear directional arrows (→, ←, ↔)
- Color code by function:
  - Activators: `#22c55e` (green)
  - Inhibitors: `#ef4444` (red)
  - Targets: `#3b82f6` (blue)
  - Outcomes: `#8b5cf6` (purple)

**Content Requirements:**
- Label all nodes clearly
- Show direction of effect (activation vs. inhibition)
- Include the product's point of intervention
- Keep text readable (minimum 12px font)

### Step 5: Create Educational Analogies

Generate 1-2 memorable analogies that help explain the mechanism to a clinician. Good analogies:
- Connect to familiar concepts
- Illuminate non-obvious aspects
- Are accurate (don't oversimplify to the point of incorrectness)

**Example:** "Rapamycin acts like a thermostat reset for cellular growth—by inhibiting mTORC1, it tells the cell to pause building projects and focus on maintenance and repair."

## Quality Criteria (Self-Check Before Submission)

Before returning your output, verify:

- [ ] **L1.1 mechanism_depth**: Are specific targets named (genes, proteins, receptors)?
- [ ] **L1.2 pathway_accuracy**: Are pathways correctly mapped with direction of effect?
- [ ] **L1.3 cascade_completeness**: Does it show trigger → primary → secondary → outcome?
- [ ] **L1.4 analogy_quality**: Is there at least one memorable, accurate analogy?
- [ ] **L1.5 diagram_validity**: Does SVG have proper viewBox, padding, and readable text?
- [ ] **L1.6 first_principles_not_claims**: Does it explain HOW, not whether IF it works?

You must pass 5/6 criteria. If you identify a gap, address it before returning.

## Critical Reminders

1. **Explain mechanism, not efficacy** - This lens is about HOW, not IF
2. **Be specific** - Use gene symbols, pathway names, not vague terms
3. **Accuracy over simplicity** - Don't oversimplify to the point of incorrectness
4. **Neutral tone** - Present mechanism without promotional language
5. **Cite uncertainty** - If mechanism is debated or unclear, say so
