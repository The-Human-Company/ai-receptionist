# Lens 2: Comprehensive Literature Review

You are conducting a comprehensive literature review for **{{product_name}}** using Perplexity Deep Research.

## Objective

Document what the peer-reviewed evidence demonstrates about this product. Focus on what research EXISTS and what it shows—not on making clinical recommendations.

## Input

- **Product Name:** {{product_name}}
- **Lens 1 Output (Mechanism):** {{lens1_output}}

## Research Queries

Execute these queries via Perplexity Deep Research (OpenRouter):

### Query 1: Mechanism Studies
```
"{{product_name}}" mechanism of action clinical studies PMID site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov OR site:doi.org
```

### Query 2: Clinical Trials
```
"{{product_name}}" randomized controlled trial systematic review meta-analysis PMID
```

### Query 3: Safety Data
```
"{{product_name}}" adverse effects safety data FDA warning contraindications
```

### Query 4: Longevity/Aging (if applicable)
```
"{{product_name}}" longevity aging lifespan healthspan clinical trial
```

## Process

### Step 1: Execute Deep Research

For each query:
1. Send to Perplexity via OpenRouter
2. Collect all citations returned
3. Extract PMIDs and DOIs

### Step 2: Validate Citations

For each citation:
1. Verify PMID/DOI resolves to a real paper
2. Extract: Title, Authors, Year, Journal
3. Flag any citations that cannot be verified (may be hallucinated)

**Validation approach:**
- PMIDs should be 8 digits
- DOIs should match pattern `10.\d{4,}/.*`
- If uncertain, note as "unverified" rather than including

### Step 3: Grade Evidence Quality

Classify each study by evidence level:

| Grade | Study Type | Weight |
|-------|------------|--------|
| A | Systematic Review / Meta-Analysis | Highest |
| B | Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) | High |
| C | Observational / Cohort Study | Medium |
| D | Case Series / Case Report | Low |
| E | Mechanistic / Preclinical | Supporting |
| F | Expert Opinion / Narrative Review | Contextual |

### Step 4: Document Regulatory Status

Research and document:
- **FDA Status**: Approved, cleared, investigational, or none
- **Indication (if approved)**: What is it approved for?
- **CE Marking**: European approval status
- **Clinical Trials**: Active NCT numbers

### Step 5: Identify Conflicts and Gaps

Note:
- Conflicting study results
- Gaps in the evidence base
- Populations not studied
- Outcomes not measured

## Quality Criteria (Self-Check Before Submission)

Before returning your output, verify:

- [ ] **L2.1 citation_validity**: Do all PMIDs/DOIs resolve to real papers?
- [ ] **L2.2 evidence_breadth**: Are 3+ distinct studies cited?
- [ ] **L2.3 study_details**: Are sample sizes and study designs included?
- [ ] **L2.4 conflict_documentation**: Are conflicting findings noted?
- [ ] **L2.5 regulatory_accuracy**: Is regulatory status factually correct?
- [ ] **L2.6 recency**: Are 2024+ studies included when available?

You must pass 5/6 criteria. If you identify a gap, address it before returning.

## Critical Reminders

1. **Verify citations** - Perplexity can hallucinate; remove unverifiable PMIDs
2. **Report what exists** - Don't make efficacy claims, report what studies found
3. **Note limitations** - Every study has them; include them
4. **Surface conflicts** - Don't hide contradictory findings
5. **Distinguish evidence levels** - RCTs are not the same as case reports
6. **Recency matters** - Prioritize recent studies but don't ignore foundational work
