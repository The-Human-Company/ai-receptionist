## Email Drafting Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Initial Draft

Use the prompt below to generate the email:

```
{initial_prompt[:500]}...
```

### Step 2: Run Quality Gate

```python
from quality_gates import evaluate_email_quality

result = evaluate_email_quality(
    email_content=draft,
    email_type="{email_type}",
    opportunity=opportunity,
    pain_points={context["pain_points"]}
)
```

### Step 3: Iterate if Needed

If quality gate fails:
1. Generate refinement prompt with failures
2. Regenerate email
3. Re-run quality gate
4. Max 3 iterations

### Step 4: Save Draft

Save to: `.bizdev/drafts/emails/{opp_id}-{email_type}.md`

Include:
- Email content
- Quality gate score
- Suggestions for manual review

## Email Drafter Usage

### IMPORTANT: Command Center Protocol (Required)

Before generating ANY email draft, you MUST follow the Command Center protocol
to prevent context loss and degradation:

```python
from command_center import CommandCenter

cc = CommandCenter.initialize()

# Step 1: Verify context is complete
ready, failures = cc.verify_context_for_email("opp-001")

if not ready:
    # Get instructions for gathering missing context
    instructions = cc.gather_missing_context_instructions("opp-001", failures)
    print(instructions)
    # Follow instructions, then record what was found:
    cc.record_transcript_search("opp-001", source_ids=[...], pain_points=[...])
    cc.record_email_search("opp-001", thread_ids=[...])
    cc.record_unified_context("opp-001")

# Step 2: Generate draft (only after context is verified)
workflow = draft_email_workflow(
    opportunity=opportunity_data,
    prior_emails=email_history,
    last_activity_days=15
)

# Step 3: After generation + quality gate, log to ledger
cc.log_email_draft(
    opportunity_id="opp-001",
    contact_name="Dr. Smith",
    content=email_content,
    file_path=workflow["output_path"],
    quality_result=gate_result.to_dict()
)

# Step 4: Finalize session
cc.finalize_session()
```

### Basic Flow (Legacy - use Command Center instead)

```python
from email_drafter import draft_email_workflow

# Get workflow instructions
workflow = draft_email_workflow(
    opportunity=opportunity_data,
    prior_emails=email_history,
    last_activity_days=15
)

print(f"Email type: {workflow['email_type']}")
print(f"Output path: {workflow['output_path']}")
```

### Integration with Quality Gates

```python
from email_drafter import generate_email_prompt, generate_email_refinement_prompt
from quality_gates import evaluate_email_quality, evaluate_context_completeness

# FIRST: Check context completeness
ctx_result = evaluate_context_completeness(context_state, "email")

    print("BLOCKED: Context incomplete")
    for suggestion in ctx_result.suggestions:
        print(f"  → {suggestion}")
    # DO NOT proceed with drafting

# Generate initial draft

# Evaluate
