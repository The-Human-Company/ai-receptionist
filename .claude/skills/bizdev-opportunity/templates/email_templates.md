## Cold Email Templates

### Template C1: Pattern Recognition Hook

**Best for:** First contact, high-potential opportunity

```
Subject: Quick thought on {pain_point_short}

{First_name},

After helping build Modern Age (first national longevity clinic) and advising 
$1B+ in longevity companies, I've noticed a pattern: {observation about their 
situation based on signals}.

Most practitioners in your position struggle with {pain_point}. The ones who 
break through typically {insight/solution hint}.

I put together a {specific resource} that might help. Worth 10 minutes to 
see if it applies to your situation?

**Best for:** When there's a warm path

```
Subject: {Mutual_connection} mentioned you

{First_name},

{Mutual_connection} suggested I reach out—mentioned you're {specific context 
from signal, e.g., "building out longevity services"}.

navigate exactly this transition. {One specific insight relevant to their 
situation}.

### Template C3: Direct Value Offer

**Best for:** Clear pain point identified

```
Subject: 5 minutes → 45 minutes (lab reports)

{First_name},

How much time did you spend on lab reports last week?

Most longevity practitioners I know spend 45+ minutes per patient translating 
labs into actionable reports. That's 15+ hours a week on something an AI can 
do in 5 minutes.

I built a tool that does exactly that—handles any biomarker type, customizes 
to your philosophy, includes citations. 240+ practitioners use it now.

Want to see a sample report for one of your patients?
