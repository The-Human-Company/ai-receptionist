Context Loader for BizDev Opportunity Intelligence

Loads relevant NGM context for opportunity processing:
1. NGM programs and pricing (from ngm-programs.md)
2. Voice and style guidelines (from document-studio)
3. Existing proposals for consistency
4. Email templates from edusales-writer

This provides the foundation for contextually-aware drafting.

NGM_VOICE_SUMMARY = """
## NGM Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Core Principles:
1. **Expert but approachable** - Confidence without arrogance
2. **Value-first** - Lead with insight, not pitch
3. **Specific over vague** - Use numbers, examples, outcomes
4. **Conversational** - Write like you talk
5. **Helpful** - Frame everything as being in service to them

### Do:
- Use "I" and "you" freely
- Reference specific experiences and outcomes
- Ask questions that show you understand their world
- Be direct about what you can and can't do

### Don't:
- Use corporate jargon
- Make vague claims ("leading", "innovative", "best")
- Over-promise or hype
- Sound like marketing copy

### Power Phrases:
- "Based on my experience building..."
- "Most practitioners I work with..."
- "Here's what actually works..."
- "The pattern I've seen..."

### CTA Style:
- Low commitment first ("Would a quick call be useful?")
- Single ask per email
- Make it easy to say yes or no
